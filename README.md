#A brief explanation of the design pattern used and why.
Just a very basic repository pattern, due to time and simple project.

#Any assumptions or design decisions made during the development process.
There was only a need for the CRUD of Feedback, I assumed there was a Category table, I did create this one due to the need for displying. But I'm asuming there is another app that take else of everything else.
